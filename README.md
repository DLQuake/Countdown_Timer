## About

This repository contains a `Python` script that allows you to enter a time in seconds and counts down to zero. It works like a timer, with the remaining time displayed in minutes and seconds format.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have `Python 3` installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: `https://www.python.org/downloads/`.

Once you have `Python` installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DLQuake/Countdown_Timer.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from [Link](https://github.com/DLQuake/Countdown_Timer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the script using Python from the command line:

```bash
python countdown.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a time in seconds. Once you have entered the time, the program will start counting down. The remaining time will be displayed in minutes and seconds format, updating every second until the countdown is complete.
